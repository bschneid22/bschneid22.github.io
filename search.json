    "section": "",
    "text": "Emmett Johnson has been impressive through two seasons in Nebraska’s backfield. The junior running back’s journey has been intriguing during his time in Lincoln. To become an elite running back in today’s landscape of college football, the ability to run and catch are as important as ever.\nBelow will be a comparison of Johnson to three former Husker running backs [Ameer Abdullah, Rex Burkhead and Roy Helu] with their statistics through their first two seasons in Lincoln.\nHere are the rushing numbers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Emmett Johnson on pace to be in the same realm of these former Husker RBs with his rushing numbers?\n\n\nThrough two seasons, the stats say yes\n\n\nYear\nAthlete\nAttempts\nYards\nAverage\nTDs\n\n\n\n\nFR\nJohnson\n90\n411\n4.6\n2\n\n\nSO\nJohnson\n117\n598\n5.1\n1\n\n\nTotal\nJohnson\n207\n1,009\n4.9\n3\n\n\nFR\nBurkhead\n81\n346\n4.3\n3\n\n\nSO\nBurkhead\n172\n951\n5.5\n7\n\n\nTotal\nBurkhead\n253\n1,297\n5.1\n10\n\n\nFR\nAbdullah\n42\n150\n3.6\n3\n\n\nSO\nAbdullah\n226\n1,137\n5.0\n8\n\n\nTotal\nAbdullah\n268\n1,287\n4.8\n11\n\n\nFR\nHelu\n45\n209\n4.6\n0\n\n\nSO\nHelu\n125\n803\n6.4\n7\n\n\nTotal\nHelu\n170\n1,012\n5.9\n7\n\n\n\nBy: Bobby Schneider | Source: sportsreference.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s clear that Johnson is on the right pace through to seasons. The 4.9 average yards-per-carry is right with Abdullah and Burkhead. Helu had a 5.9 average, but his amount of carries were significantly less than Abdullah, Burkhead and Johnson.\nThe total rushing yardage Johnson comes in third, just three yards above Helu, but once again, the amount of carries are less than Abdullah and Burkhead. There was numerous times over the last two seasons where Johnson would get minimal touches.\nMoreover, Johnson’s rushing touchdowns were less than each of the three running backs he’s compared to, yet Nebraska’s offense as a whole was less productive during Johnson’s two seasons getting carries.\nThe receiving numbers sets Johnson apart. Here are the receiving statistics for Johnson, Burkhead, Abdullah and Helu through two seasons:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson’s redshirt freshman season he only had 46 receiving yards, but looking at his sophomore campaign, he tore it apart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson’s a little behind Abdullah and Burkhead through two years when it comes to all-purpose yards, but he’s on the correct road. In conclusion, Johnson is within spitting distance in some categories, and some ahead. Overall, the junior Husker running back should be set to have quite the breakthrough junior season in Nebraska’s backfield."
