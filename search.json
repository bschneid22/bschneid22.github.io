    "text": "Emmett Johnson has been impressive through two seasons in Nebraska’s backfield. The junior running back’s journey has been intriguing during his time in Lincoln. To become an elite running back in today’s landscape of college football, the ability to run and catch is as important as ever.\nBelow will be a comparison of Johnson to three former Husker running backs [Ameer Abdullah, Rex Burkhead and Roy Helu] with their statistics through their first two seasons in Lincoln.\nHere are the rushing numbers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Emmett Johnson on pace to be in the same realm of these former Husker RBs with his rushing numbers?\n\n\nThrough two seasons, the stats say yes\n\n\nYear\nAthlete\nAttempts\nYards\nAverage\nTDs\n\n\n\n\nFR\nJohnson\n90\n411\n4.6\n2\n\n\nSO\nJohnson\n117\n598\n5.1\n1\n\n\nTotal\nJohnson\n207\n1,009\n4.9\n3\n\n\nFR\nBurkhead\n81\n346\n4.3\n3\n\n\nSO\nBurkhead\n172\n951\n5.5\n7\n\n\nTotal\nBurkhead\n253\n1,297\n5.1\n10\n\n\nFR\nAbdullah\n42\n150\n3.6\n3\n\n\nSO\nAbdullah\n226\n1,137\n5.0\n8\n\n\nTotal\nAbdullah\n268\n1,287\n4.8\n11\n\n\nFR\nHelu\n45\n209\n4.6\n0\n\n\nSO\nHelu\n125\n803\n6.4\n7\n\n\nTotal\nHelu\n170\n1,012\n5.9\n7\n\n\n\nBy: Bobby Schneider | Source: sportsreference.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s clear that Johnson is on the right pace through to seasons. The 4.9 average yards-per-carry is right with Abdullah and Burkhead. Helu had a 5.9 average, but his amount of carries was significantly less than Abdullah, Burkhead and Johnson.\nThe total rushing yardage Johnson comes in third, just three yards above Helu, but once again, the amount of carries is less than Abdullah and Burkhead. There were numerous times over the last two seasons where Johnson would get minimal touches.\nMoreover, Johnson’s rushing touchdowns were less than each of the three running backs he’s compared to, yet Nebraska’s offense as a whole was less productive during Johnson’s two seasons getting carries.\nThe receiving numbers set Johnson apart. Here are the receiving statistics for Johnson, Burkhead, Abdullah and Helu through two seasons:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson’s redshirt freshman season he only had 46 receiving yards, but looking at his sophomore campaign, he tore it apart. Johnson jumped his receiving yardage to 286 as a sophomore wearing the scarlet and cream.\nThe top two red dots in the upper right corner show the jump that Johnson made in his second season. He had the best of the three in total receiving yards out of the backfield with 332 yards racked up through the air.\nSo, how does Johnson’s rushing and receiving put together compare?\nHere are the all-purpose yards produced for each of the four running backs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson’s a little behind Abdullah and Burkhead through two years but is above Helu for all-purpose yardage, but he’s on the right road. In conclusion, Johnson is within spitting distance in some categories, and some ahead.\nOverall, the junior Husker running back should be set to have quite the breakthrough junior season in Nebraska’s backfield. It will be intriguing to compare Johnson to these three after his junior season. The rushing yardage might not reach the other three, but the all-purpose very well could, with Johnson’s ability to catch the ball out of the backfield."
